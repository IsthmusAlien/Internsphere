## Usage
Wake on LAN (WoL) is a network protocol that allows a device to be turned on or awakened remotely
over a network while it is sleeping. This project aims to make the process of waking devices easy with a mobile application. 

<!--- by including features like automatic device discovery so the user does not have to enter details of a device they want to wake up manually, a simple interface to send the Wake On Lan packets and the possibility to export and import the user data as a `json` file. -->

## Features

- Automatic device discovery
- Simple interface to send Wake On Lan packets
- Export and import user data as a `json` file (see below)


The app stores the added devices in a `json` file which can be exported and imported within the app UI. An example of the file structure is shown below:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "6b353440-d183-11ed-964b-69a9facd6cfd",
    "hostName": "Raspberry Pi",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.9",
    "macAddress": "12:12:12:12:12:12",
    "wolPort": 9,
    "deviceType": "computer",
    "modified": "2023-04-14T14:17:45.974511"
  },
  {
    "id": "87c87ab0-d184-13ed-9d56-a5f550305985",
    "hostName": "Printer",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.10",
    "macAddress": "f0:f0:f0:f0:f0:f0",
    "wolPort": 9,
    "deviceType": "printer",
    "modified": "2023-04-14T14:18:14.997081"
  }
]
```
