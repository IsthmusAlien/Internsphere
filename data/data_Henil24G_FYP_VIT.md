Industrial IoT-Based Gas Pipe Leakage Detector Robot

Abstract: Energy resources such as gas often transported through pipes which play a significant role in cities, industries. Gas leakage in pipes prompts misfortune just as a danger since they can likewise prompt flame mishaps. The point of this work is to structure an independent robot for in-pipe investigation. The system utilized includes a focal pole whereupon a translational component is fitted which thusly is associated with three edges of connections and wheels. DC motors are joined to the wheels to accomplish the drive required. The component considers little settlement in-pipe distances across. Setting sensors on each segment of pipe is in all respects exorbitant. A pipe crawling robot prototype that can detect the leakage of Methane, Butane, LPG, Smoke in a pipe by moving horizontally and vertically to prevent mishaps in industries. The Internet of Things (IoT) module is interfaced with a robot to give a real-time analysis on the cloud platform and GPS to give the exact location of the leakage.
