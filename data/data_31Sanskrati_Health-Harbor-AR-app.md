## Project Description
This app utilizes AR technology to provide users with a visual guide to understanding how alcohol consumption affects the human body. With the help of models created using Blender.

## Key Features :point_down:

- **3D Organ Models:** The app showcases 3D models of organs created using Blender, allowing users to explore them in augmented reality.
- **Impact Visualization:** Different models depict the effects of alcohol on various organs, such as the liver (healthy, alcoholic hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and cirrhosis).
- **Personalized Scan Mode:** Users can enter personal data like age, gender, and alcohol consumption habits. The app estimates the potential condition of their organs after a certain period of continued drinking.
