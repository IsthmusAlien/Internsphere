Arduino sketch showcases IoT skills with ESP8266, DHT11, and MQ2 sensors using Blynk for data visualization. Displays competency in sensor integration and readiness to explore new functionalities like rain sensing. Reflects my passion for IoT and interest in mathematical biology.

The provided Arduino sketch showcases my engagement with IoT, sensor integration, and data communication through Blynk. This code orchestrates an ESP8266 module, connecting it to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266WiFi.h library. It interfaces with various sensors like the DHT11 for temperature and humidity monitoring, an LDR for light sensing, and an MQ2 gas sensor for detecting gas levels.

I've meticulously organized the code by defining pin assignments for each sensor and initializing them in the setup function. The integration with Blynk, facilitated by BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h, allows seamless transmission of sensor data to the Blynk app, ensuring real-time monitoring and analysis.

Additionally, I've included conditional statements to execute actions based on sensor readings, such as activating an LED according to the LDR readings and triggering a buzzer concerning gas sensor values, showcasing my ability to respond to sensor data in practical scenarios.

I should note that certain sections of the code, denoted by comments, are potential expansions involving rain sensing (RainSense), although they're currently inactive. While not yet fully implemented, these segments demonstrate my readiness to explore and integrate additional functionalities.

This code reflects my initiative in IoT, sensor interfacing, and utilization of Blynk for data visualization, aligning with my eagerness to further delve into such interdisciplinary realms, especially within the context of mathematical approaches to biological systems.
